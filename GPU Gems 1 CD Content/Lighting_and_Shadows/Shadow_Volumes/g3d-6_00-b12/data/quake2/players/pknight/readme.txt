Model description       : This is a model from the RPG Perilith, which
                          is currently in development.  Perilith was
                          going to use the Quake 2 engine, but Unreal
                          is more suited to our purpose. Instead of 
                          letting the Q2 work go to waste, the first
                          model was finished as a Q2 PPM.

Known Bugs              : Brace yourself...

The construction of the model itself is a little weak; I would have 
done several things differently if I had to do it over. The flames 
didn't turn out looking quite as flame-like as I had hoped. The salute 
animation is a little stiff, for example the cloth doesn't move that 
well and the weapon rotates a little to smoothly to be natural. I cut 
major corners on the left hand. Sometimes wierd things happen with the 
loincloth, but I don't think it's that noticeable. I'm not sure if the 
weapons are a bit improper or not; let's just say they're "magical", 
OK? A few of the weapons don't make sense if you taunt or salute (etc.) 
since they are so different; ie. crossbow (grapple) and grenade 
(flaming potion). There's not enough skins. The weapons that are 
animated look wierd underwater, since only the first jump frame is 
displayed (flaming weapons, BFG, rocket launcher, railgun). CDeath and
Death1 are similar, but I like the way it looks so I kept it that way. 
There's an extra default frame at the start of the salute. The run 
animation isn't matched up with feet movement as nicely as Mr. Steed's.
A bit of texture streching here and there, but that's the cost of 
making an easy to follow mapping layout. The "newer" VWeps are not
included, but will be if I find enough people need them, and if I get
some good ideas/suggestions for the weapons.

Build/Animation time    : We're not even going to go there....


* How to use this model *

Extract this archive into your Quake2 directory.  It has it's own
internal directory structure in an attempt to make sure everyone has it
in the same location, and so the weapon skin shows up properly (it's
tied into the directory name somehow).  Whatever happens, the intention
is that the model will be installed into the following path:

    <quake2 dir>\baseq2\players\pknight
eg:
    c:\quake2\baseq2\players\pknight


* Background information on the Knight *

Born into a dynasty of power, trapped by a legacy of rite and tradition,
and freed by a tragedy that destroyed his family -- and his betrothed --
Lon Gailand abandoned his heritage as an Armigerian Knight and
his birthright as King to find a new purpose in his life...  only to
become ensnared in a struggle beyond his comprehension, by powers
far, far greater than himself alone...


* Background information on Perilith *

Contact with Karch has been lost.  What was once a great city on the
mountainous slopes of western Aldergast, rich in trade and culture,
now no longer exists.  Travelers and caravans claim having found
nothing but tortured earth for miles, teeming with a tainted Flow
and rife with foul creatures...  if they return at all...

Far to the east, Karch's sister city, Calithein, battles with an influx
of creatures of darkness from a dungeon to the north, vainly attempting
to prevent the monsters from storming the city...

In the middle of the Southern Sea, a magician-in-training awakens from
a prophetic dream of events to come, only to be ignored...  and then
denied access to the ancient texts which may prove his dream to be
all too true...

Across the world of Perilith, an ancient struggle against the forces of
chaos and destruction has ensued anew...  except the nature of the evil
is unknown...  and the means of vanquishing it are even more unclear...

Spawned from seven thousand years of history, Perilith will be an RPG
of heretofore unseen proportions, a pioneering effort in creation,
distribution, and world evolution.

May the Creator dream of you kindly.

* But how the hell did he get in the Quake2 universe? *

Lets just say there was this big, nasty, magical accident. Call it
plane shifing if you will. The poor guy wakes up and can't figure out
what's going on, but there seems to be a lot of killing going on 
around him, and he was always kind of good at killing stuff...
